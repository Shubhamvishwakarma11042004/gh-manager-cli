## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Git

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gh-manager-cli.git
cd gh-manager-cli

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Run the CLI
node dist/index.js
# or link for development
pnpm link
gh-manager
```

### Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code
  - `ui/` - React/Ink UI components
  - `github.ts` - GitHub API integration
  - `config.ts` - Configuration management
  - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `dist/` - Built output (gitignored)
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `AGENTS.md` - Project architecture and development guide
- `TODOs.md` - Project roadmap and task tracking

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feat/add-repository-actions` - New features
- `fix/sorting-bug` - Bug fixes  
- `docs/update-readme` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/github-client` - Code refactoring

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning and changelog generation:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `build` - Build system changes
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `chore` - Other changes

**Examples:**
```
feat: add repository deletion with confirmation modal
fix: resolve terminal rendering issues in SSH environments
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: extract GitHub API client to separate module
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your changes work across different terminals
2. **Update documentation** - Update AGENTS.md if changing architecture
3. **Check TODOs.md** - Mark relevant items as complete
4. **Follow code standards** - Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
5. **Test terminal compatibility** - Verify in multiple terminal apps

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a clear title** - Will be auto-formatted to conventional commits
2. **Describe your changes** - Explain what and why
3. **Reference issues** - Link to related issues if applicable
4. **Update tests** - Add or update tests for new functionality
5. **Check CI** - Ensure all automated checks pass

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript - no `any` types without justification
- Provide comprehensive type definitions
- Use functional components with hooks for React/Ink
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### UI/UX Guidelines

- **Terminal compatibility** - Test in multiple terminal emulators
- **Color usage** - Use chalk for pre-coloring to avoid nested Text issues
- **Performance** - Keep terminal UIs fast and responsive
- **Accessibility** - Ensure keyboard navigation works intuitively

### Key Technical Constraints

- **Ink rendering** - Use Box components for layout, avoid nested Text
- **Terminal differences** - Account for SSH vs native terminal rendering
- **Virtualization** - Consider performance with large repository lists
- **API limits** - Respect GitHub rate limits and provide clear feedback

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test in multiple terminals (iTerm2, Terminal.app, SSH/Termius)
- [ ] Test with different window sizes
- [ ] Test with large numbers of repositories
- [ ] Test API error scenarios (network issues, invalid tokens)
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation thoroughly
- [ ] Verify sorting works correctly
- [ ] Test filtering functionality

### Automated Testing

Currently, the project relies primarily on manual testing. Automated testing contributions are welcome:
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for GitHub API
- Snapshot tests for UI components (where feasible)

## Documentation

### When to Update Documentation

- **AGENTS.md** - For architectural changes or new development patterns
- **README.md** - For user-facing changes or installation updates
- **TODOs.md** - Mark completed items, add new planned features
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - For process or guideline changes

### Documentation Standards

- Keep README concise, point to detailed docs
- Use AGENTS.md for comprehensive technical documentation
- Maintain TODOs.md as the single source of truth for roadmap
- Include code examples where helpful

## Issue Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

Include:
- Operating system and terminal app
- Node.js version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages or screenshots

### Feature Requests

Include:
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed solution or behavior
- Alternative solutions considered
- Impact on existing functionality

### Questions

- Check AGENTS.md and README.md first
- Search existing issues
- Provide context about what you're trying to achieve

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Branch is up to date with main
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Changes tested in multiple terminals
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] TODOs.md updated if applicable
- [ ] No merge conflicts

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** - CI must pass
2. **Manual review** - Code quality and architecture
3. **Testing** - Functionality verification
4. **Documentation** - Completeness check
5. **Merge** - Squash merge with conventional commit title

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Start development mode with auto-rebuild
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Test the built CLI
node dist/index.js

# Link for global testing
pnpm link
gh-manager
```

### Release Process

Releases are automated via semantic-release:
1. Merge to main branch
2. GitHub Actions runs semantic-release
3. Version calculated from conventional commits
4. CHANGELOG.md generated automatically
5. GitHub release created with notes

### Getting Help

- Check [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for technical details
- Review [TODOs.md](./TODOs.md) for planned work
- Open an issue for questions or discussions
- Review existing issues and pull requests

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- GitHub contributors list
- Release notes for significant contributions
- AGENTS.md for architectural contributions
